# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Matt]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [April 11, Monday, 2022].

## Log

### R1D1 
Want to spend today writing some code which analyses my twitter followers and does something with it. I've recently written code which connects to twitter and sends tweets, this seems like a natural progression.

Didn't go so well, learned the responce method in python. Reassessing in the morning, knackered!

### R1D2
Spent today jumping back in with JavaScript. Reasonably enjoyable, need to remember my semicolons! May jump back in later, while learnign the essentials is essential, it doesn't set the world on fire (I know it gets more interesting).

### R1D3
Today I continued with JavaScript. I spent my time brushing up on  my syntax. I then chose to produce a simple card game to play with JS and test my skills. I built a test webpage to help run the code, and started producing my java script.

### R1D4
No "proper" code today. Spent my time problem solving issues with VS Code. Will get back into the JS tomorrow.

### R1D5
Got back into it today. Spent my time building functions in JavaScript, passing values between them, and then implamenting a switch case situation to deal with some simple card scoring.

### R1D6
Met some challenges when trying to work out scoring comparisons today. need to rethink my code, good excuse to learn a little more about objects tomorrow.

### R1D7
values assigned to cards using the return function, scoring system also introduced. Everything checked with the HTML file. Started learning about DOM manipulation.

### R1D8
Moved back to python for today. looked at different ways of displaying data using twitter. images, graphs, and text formatting were all explored. Tables remain out of reach.

### R1D9
Kept on pluggin away at my Java Script today. Also looked into LoRa on a meshtastic board, I may want to produce an airplane tracker at some point.

### R1D10
Finally got into DOM manipulation, god that's fun!. Now have the console commands updating the HTML to give actual views of both the cards and the score. Test buttons removed.

### R1D11
Returned to basics and went back over flex for CSS. Center aligned the game, built two different containers, more work needed on flex.

### R1D12
Continued with flex and css, still not happy with my understanding of flex. Need to continue down this path, website orientation is important.

### R1D13
Continued with flex, moving things around webpages with varying degrees of success!

### R1D14
Still getting through flex. Made some progress, produced a cleaner webpage to work on. all functionality carried over, just cleaner and easier to track changes.

### R1D15
Good day of flex. Positioned items exactly as i wanted them. Lost atributes added back. Mini project completed in all real regards. Pictures of cards could be added (entire deck of cards could be added too!!).

### R1D16
Started adding new features, game now fully rests when "new game" is selected, high score system started on, though not working yet, will return to this tomorrow.

### R2D1
Got back on horse, build neural network. Today i plan on fixing some errors and getting back to the Odin Project. Didn't manage to fix the error, but i did reproduce them. Proect Odin restarted, looking at JS.

### R2D2
Continued with project odin, completed another exercise. Also continued on my quest to fix the RNN, will have this sorted, but may need to rewrite my text generator!

### R2D3
Worked through another exercise, completed it without support, syntax is coming back! Completed the reversing text exercise, enjoyed it, exactly the right amount of challenge, looking forward to it ramping up though.

### R2D4
I've really got into generating AI art, it've been terrible at keeping the log, but seem to have rediscovered my spark, burning the midnight oil long into the small hours. Felt good, going to get back to project odin soon.

### R2D5
Today i added a full blog to my website, I created a new page to display is, a database to store the posts, and another page to add posts. I was absolutely blown away when i got it all to work.

### R2D6
I've kept going, really thrown myself into AI, messing around with both chat GPT clones, and image generation. Really been enjoying learning the finer art of both system. What i havent been very good at is keeping track with what i've been doing!
