## Log

### R1D1 
Want to spend today writing some code which analyses my twitter followers and does something with it. I've recently written code which connects to twitter and sends tweets, this seems like a natural progression.

Didn't go so well, learned the responce method in python. Reassessing in the morning, knackered!

### R1D2
Spent today jumping back in with JavaScript. Reasonably enjoyable, need to remember my semicolons! May jump back in later, while learnign the essentials is essential, it doesn't set the world on fire (I know it gets more interesting).

### R1D3
Today I continued with JavaScript. I spent my time brushing up on  my syntax. I then chose to produce a simple card game to play with JS and test my skills. I built a test webpage to help run the code, and started producing my java script.

### R1D4
No "proper" code today. Spent my time problem solving issues with VS Code. Will get back into the JS tomorrow.

### R1D5
Got back into it today. Spent my time building functions in JavaScript, passing values between them, and then implamenting a switch case situation to deal with some simple card scoring.

### R1D6
Met some challenges when trying to work out scoring comparisons today. need to rethink my code, good excuse to learn a little more about objects tomorrow.

### R1D7
values assigned to cards using the return function, scoring system also introduced. Everything checked with the HTML file. Started learning about DOM manipulation.

### R1D8
Moved back to python for today. looked at different ways of displaying data using twitter. images, graphs, and text formatting were all explored. Tables remain out of reach.

### R1D9
Kept on pluggin away at my Java Script today. Also looked into LoRa on a meshtastic board, I may want to produce an airplane tracker at some point.

### R1D10
Finally got into DOM manipulation, god that's fun!. Now have the console commands updating the HTML to give actual views of both the cards and the score. Test buttons removed.

### R1D11
Returned to basics and went back over flex for CSS. Center aligned the game, built two different containers, more work needed on flex.

### R1D12
Continued with flex and css, still not happy with my understanding of flex. Need to continue down this path, website orientation is important.
