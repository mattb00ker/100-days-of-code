The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [April 11, Monday, 2022].

## Log

### R1D1 
Want to spend today writing some code which analyses my twitter followers and does something with it. I've recently written code which connects to twitter and sends tweets, this seems like a natural progression.

Didn't go so well, learned the responce method in python. Reassessing in the morning, knackered!

### R1D2
Spent today jumping back in with JavaScript. Reasonably enjoyable, need to remember my semicolons! May jump back in later, while learnign the essentials is essential, it doesn't set the world on fire (I know it gets more interesting).
