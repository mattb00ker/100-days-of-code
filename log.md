# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 3, Sunday


**Today's Progress**: None, decided to have a go at the 100 days of code challenge. Have cleaned out a twitter account to focus on my coding.

**Thoughts:**
Worried about my commitment. Want this to be a successful experience.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: GitHub set up and working. Decided to build a twitter follower analyser as my first small project. Should be easy enough to launch myself into the challenge. 

**Thoughts**: I need to spend some time going through the other member of the challenge. Reasons are two fold, check to see the kinds of this others are doing, and to bring my formatting up to scratch.
