# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 3, Sunday


**Today's Progress**: None, decided to have a go at the 100 days of code challenge. Have cleaned out a twitter account to focus on my coding.

**Thoughts:**
Worried about my commitment. Want this to be a successful experience.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: GitHub set up and working. Decided to build a twitter follower analyser as my first small project. Should be easy enough to launch myself into the challenge. 

I've learned about python's responce method, seen it in use and played with it. Definition was found here [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/response-methods-python-requests/)

Famous last words, Twitter has reduced the number of followers you can call to 1000, well below what i would need. I had fun exploring Tweepy, a python library I've used before. I also explored Twitter's own API, which while interesting, wasn't nearly neat enough for my liking.

Did learn about Twitter userID's, used the following website to discover those i needed for the tests [Twitter ID's](https://tweeterid.com/)

**Thoughts**: I need to spend some time going through the repros of other members of the challenge. Reasons are two fold, check to see the kinds of this others are doing, and to bring my formatting up to scratch. Need to redefine my task tomorrow...
